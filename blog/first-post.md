🚑 Welcome to the Future of EMT Training: Scenario-Based Learning with AI

Becoming a great EMT takes more than memorizing protocols — it takes experience, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt under pressure. That’s why I created this project: an interactive EMS training platform that puts students directly into realistic, AI-powered scenarios, where every question, decision, and treatment mirrors what they'd face in the field.

👨‍⚕️ Why Scenario-Based Learning Matters
Traditional classroom lectures and flashcards can only go so far. EMTs need to practice thinking like providers, not just students. Scenario-based learning bridges that gap by:

Simulating real-life emergencies

Encouraging clinical decision-making

Reinforcing protocols through practical application

Building confidence through repetition and feedback

Imagine running a full medical call — from scene size-up to transport decision — right from your phone or laptop, anytime.

⚙️ How the EMS Simulator Works
This project combines AI with EMT education to create a fully interactive learning experience. Users can:

Ask the patient questions and get realistic answers

Perform assessments and interventions

Receive feedback and a score aligned with NREMT skill sheets

Practice both medical and trauma calls with evolving scenarios

Whether you're preparing for the NREMT or just sharpening your skills, the simulator helps you train smarter, not harder.

🔥 Built by an EMT, for EMTs
As a paramedic and EMS instructor with over 20 years in the field, I’ve seen firsthand where students struggle — and where simulations make all the difference. My goal is to create the most affordable, realistic, and accessible EMS training tool available. No downloads, no expensive VR headsets. Just smart, practical training that adapts to you.

📚 What’s Next
In the coming weeks, I’ll be rolling out:

New scenarios (chest pain, shortness of breath, trauma, pediatrics)

Voice interactions with the patient and proctor

Learning Mode with in-scenario coaching

Full grading and performance tracking

Stay tuned, follow along, and get ready to level up your EMT training.

👋 Let’s Connect

Whether you're a student, educator, or EMS professional, I’d love to hear what you think. Try a scenario, share your feedback, and help shape the future of EMS education.
